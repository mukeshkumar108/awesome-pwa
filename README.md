# The Awesome PWA Boilerplate

A modern, production-ready Progressive Web App (PWA) template built for speed and developer happiness.This isn't just another templateâ€”it's a launchpad for your next big idea. We've thrown in all the good stuff so you can stop wrestling with setup and start building.

## Key Features
- **Modern Stack**: React, TypeScript, and Vite for a blazing-fast development experience.
- **Plug-and-Play Authentication**: Seamless integration with Supabase for secure user management and a database that just works.
- **Killer Aesthetics**: A gorgeous, responsive UI powered by Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, so you don't have to be a design genius to make it look amazing.
- **Silky-Smooth UX**: Built-in animations with Framer Motion to give your app that polished, premium feel.
- **Ready for Prime Time**: This PWA is ready for deployment on services like Vercel and can be easily converted to a React Native app down the line.
